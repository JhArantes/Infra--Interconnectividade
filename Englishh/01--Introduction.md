## üö¶ What is a Computer Network?  

Imagine a **digital city** where:  
- üè¢ **Devices** (PCs, servers, smartphones) are like "houses"  
- üõ£Ô∏è **Cables and wireless signals** are the "streets"  
- üì¶ **Data** are the "packages" that travel  
- üè∑Ô∏è **IP addresses** are the "ZIP codes" of this city  

> üí° **Fun fact:** The first computer network (ARPANET) emerged in 1969 and connected only 4 universities in the USA!

## üîÅ Client-Server Model

The **client-server** model is one of the main communication models in networks:

- **Client**: requests data or services.  
- **Server**: responds to requests and provides resources.

Example: when you access a website, your browser (client) connects to a web server that sends the page content.

## üß© Hardware vs. Software in Networks

| Hardware (Physical)         | Software (Logical)                |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Switches, Routers          | Protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, etc.)    |
| Network cables             | IP addressing                     |
| Network Interface Cards (NICs) | Network operating systems       |

Together, hardware and software make **storing, sending, and routing data** efficiently possible, using **IP addresses** to identify the correct destinations.

## üåç Types of Networks

### üîπ LAN ‚Äì *Local Area Network*  
Local network used in homes, offices, and schools. High speed and limited coverage.

### üîπ MAN ‚Äì *Metropolitan Area Network*  
Metropolitan network, covering larger urban areas, such as cities or university campuses.

### üîπ WAN ‚Äì *Wide Area Network*  
Long-distance network that interconnects cities, countries, or continents (e.g., the internet itself).

### üîπ WLAN ‚Äì *Wireless Local Area Network*  
Wireless version of LAN, based on technologies like Wi-Fi.

## üèóÔ∏è Network Architecture: Essential Fundamentals

A well-designed network architecture should consider the following pillars:

1. ‚úÖ **Fault Tolerance**  
   Ability to continue functioning even in the face of technical problems.

2. üöÄ **Scalability**  
   Ease of expanding the network as new devices or users are added.

3. üì∂ **QoS ‚Äì Quality of Service**  
   Performance and traffic priority control (e.g., prioritizing VoIP calls over downloads).

4. üîê **Security**  
   Protection of data and infrastructure against unauthorized access and attacks.

## üíæ Example of Operation

When a user sends a file via email:  
1. The **client software** assembles the data.  
2. The data is **addressed with the recipient's IP**.  
3. The **network hardware** (routers, switches) routes the packets correctly to the destination.
